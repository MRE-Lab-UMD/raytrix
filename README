this node takes the streaming image and converts to useable 3D info.
comes in as a (2008*2008?) image with virtual depth. converts virtual depth to
metric depth following raytrix equations for plenoptic cameras and the
information gleaned from calibration.
calibration includes 2D intrinsic calibration and 3D metric calibration.
